# 🗓 Rust Events team

This is the repository for any planning of the [Rust events team](https://github.com/rust-community/team#%EF%B8%8F-events). If you are running an event we would love to offer some tips and contacts along with our experience to make it as smooth as possible.

## Material

- **Meetups:** Open an issue using [this template](https://github.com/rust-community/events-team/issues/new?template=new_meetup.md) ❤️


# 🚀 Helping out

The Rust events team meets every other week on [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/EkKINhHCgZ9llzvPidOssA) at 5 pm UTC, where we discuss any [open issues](https://github.com/rust-community/events/issues). We are happy to answer any questions, so feel free to comment or even resolve any issues in this repository 😁.  

Alternatively, you can also email us at [community@rust-lang.org](mailto:community@rust-lang.org).
